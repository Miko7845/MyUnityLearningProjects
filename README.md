# Prototype-1 

This project is about making a car game in Unity, where you can control the car to dodge or hit obstacles on a floating road. By the end of the project, you will have a fun and interactive game that you can customize and play.

The project includes another mini-game in a separate scene: This scene is about making a flying game in Unity, where you can control the plane to fly around obstacles in the sky.
